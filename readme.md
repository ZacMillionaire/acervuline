##About

An incredibly specific program designed to extract a range of information from a series of web pages.

I wouldn't recommend running this at all, unless you want data, and lots of it.

##Todo

* Impliment tests
	* Impliment real tests.
* Sort out the actual data mining function to not return lists in lists.
* Change the regex to be more specific in what its after in some cases, and to format strings before appending to file.
* Change from dumping data to creating sql queries
* Probably a lot more drinking
